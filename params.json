It runs by default in daemon-mode, and allows only one instance. If started with the `-g` or `--gui` options, it will use kdialog to present a quick and simple configuration dialog, which will let you set the time between checks and the icon sent to notify-send. Other options, such as audio notifications, update-checking mechanism, and notification program and options, can be set in either the global `/etc/spun.conf` or local `~/.spunrc` configuration files. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
